# Termtrace

Termtrace records terminal and TUI sessions as two synchronized sources of evidence:

- native Ghostty screenshots and 24 FPS video for human visual review;
- a byte-exact event log replayed through `libghostty-vt` for agent-readable terminal states.

The raw event log is authoritative. Videos, screenshots, text, JSON, VT, and HTML views are derived artifacts that can be regenerated after a session exits.

> [!WARNING]
> Terminal recordings can contain prompts, source code, environment details, credentials, clipboard data, and typed secrets. Session directories are owner-only by default and must be treated as sensitive.

## Status

Termtrace is under active development. The architecture and acceptance criteria are documented in [Architecture](docs/architecture.md).

## Development

The repository pins its Rust toolchain. Validate a change with:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
